# Random Sales Agent

At my job, the customer support team sometimes receives a voicemail or email from someone interested in buying. So far, we've lacked an easy and fair pick a sales agent to transfer the lead to. This app will solve that problem buy allowing the user to select which sales agents are in the office at the time and pick one at random.

## To use:

### Randomizer:
1. Ensure all present agents are selected (boxes will be green for present, absent for red).
2. Click orange "go" button. The random agent's name will appear on your screen.
3. Rinse and repeat.
